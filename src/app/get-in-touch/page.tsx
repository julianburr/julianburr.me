        Hi there, you want to get in touch with me? That’s great. I could give
        you my personal email here, but I don’t check my inbox very frequently
        and would probably miss your message.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you want to say hello or have a chat, just get in touch with me
        via the socials below.
      </p>
      <p>...</p>
    </>
  );
