      <p>
        This is not a blog, just a collection of small bits and pieces of
        knowledge I picked up on my way. We learn something new every day, so I
        wanted to keep that gained knowledge accessible for later. It also makes
        sharing easier. Most of it is just random thoughts and code snippets,
        with links to further resources.
